# Weather-Dashboard-ServerSideAPIs
## Why was this project created?
This project was made so that users can look up current and future weather data all around the world. They can also click a button to populate more data based on their previous searches. This can be helpful when they aren't sure how to dress for an occasion or if they are going on a trip and want to know what kind of clothing they should pack for their journey.

## What this project has taught me
This project helped me "deep-dive" into what it's like to use server-side APIs and how they can be implemented in my future career. I learned a lot more about how arrays and objects work, and how you can find the path in the data to get the exact information you need. LocalStorage is still pretty tricky to me, so I've gotten a lot more comfortable with console.logging data to understand where my variables are retrieving their data.

<summary> Process Summary </summary>

Created remote repo and cloned to local machine

Made all the files

Linked js, Bulma, jquery, dayjs & stylesheet

Curl to make sure API was working properly

Set up the GUI with Bulma

Started "plugging & playing" with the weather data and dayjs

Started using the github issues to keep track of what needs to be resolved, as the bugs are NOT features lol

ASTRONOMICALLY messed up the entire application but got localStorage to work- had to revert changes and start over from before localStorage was working

Created 3-4 solid github issues to focus on that are part of the acceptance criteria

Copy and pasted README set-up from Web API Code Quiz repo

Started updating the README file to sort of take a short break from debugging my application

Chose to use bulma to style this assignment so I could get comfortable using it for the group project- since we weren't allowed to use bootstrap

I helped Salvador Mejia with his localStorage and he helped me and Timothy Morgan get our icons to append to the GUI
